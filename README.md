# Hello Team Sweeft!

## this is my solution to given task

[deployment on s3](http://sweeft-infinitescroll.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/)

 deployments doesn't work unfortunately due to cross origin policy,but hopefully it should work locally

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
https -x http: api call from axios

```

infinite scrolling functionality is implemented 

 project was bootstrapped with Create React App so most of the command are same.
